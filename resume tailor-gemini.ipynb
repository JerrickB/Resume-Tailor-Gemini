      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Targeted Summary:**  The revised summary now explicitly mentions years of experience and incorporates relevant keywords like \"design,\" \"maintain,\" \"clean code,\" and \"code review,\" demonstrating alignment with potential job requirements.\n",
      "* **Action-Oriented Language:** The experience section now utilizes stronger action verbs like \"designed,\" \"developed,\" and \"ensured,\" making the descriptions more impactful. \n",
      "* **Skill Organization:** Grouping skills into categories improves readability and allows recruiters to quickly assess expertise. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Areas for Improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Quantify and Expand on Achievements:** While using action verbs is good, the bullet points in the experience section would benefit from more quantifiable achievements.  For example, instead of \"Successfully deployed and managed applications on cloud platforms,\" try: \"Successfully deployed and managed 5+ web applications on AWS, resulting in a 15% increase in platform stability.\"\n",
      "* **Tailor Skills More Closely:** While the skills section is well-organized, you should prioritize and tailor it to each job description. If a specific job emphasizes AWS cloud experience, list it prominently and include relevant projects or achievements using that technology. \n",
      "* **Address Potential Gaps:** The summary mentions 2+ years of experience, but some job listings might require 3+. You could address this by highlighting relevant personal projects or internships that demonstrate the required skillset, even if they fall outside formal work experience.\n",
      "* **Cover Letter Synergy:** A strong cover letter is essential for elaborating on your qualifications and directly addressing the specific needs and challenges mentioned in the job description. Ensure your cover letter complements the resume and provides concrete examples of your skills in action.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary and Additional Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The revised resume shows a good understanding of tailoring content to a job listing. However, to further increase its impact, focus on:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Quantifying achievements and using specific metrics to demonstrate your impact.**\n",

      "* **Writing a compelling cover letter that complements your resume and showcases your enthusiasm for the specific position.** \n",
